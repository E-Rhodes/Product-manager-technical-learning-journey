# Product-manager-technical-learning-journey
I’m a product manager with 10+ years’ experience. I’m learning CS and AI so I can prototype, validate, and ship faster in the age of AI. I’m documenting everything — wins, failures, and lessons for other PMs who want to do the same.

Fyi - this readme is written in Markdown! which is a a lightweight, easy-to-read, and easy-to-write plain text formatting syntax.

# CS50x
  I shall be starting my journey with the introduction to computer science by working my way through the Havard CS50x course via the edx learning platform. 

OBVIOUSLY! sharing my repo (new Word!- a place where code relating to a project is stored) would be a big no as it would give the world all of the answers to CS50 (because i'll of course have all the answers.... :-/) but dont worry I'll be adding reflections on the journey, screenshots, that dont get me introuble and also links to workout side of the course.
